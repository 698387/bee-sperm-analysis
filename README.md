# bee-sperm-analysis
Automation of the analysis of bee's sperm by computer vision. Detection and tracking the cells from videos obtained by a microscope. 

## Goals

- Performance a detection of the different cells, obtaining the position and the form of each cell
  - Via classic vision computation
- Track each cell from video using filters, so it is possible to define *good* from bad *cells*
